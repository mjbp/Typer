	<h1>Title</h1>
	<p>Kenya's David Rudisha stormed to 800m gold in a world record time at London 2012 to cap four years of dominance of the two-lap event.</p>
	<p>The 23-year-old world champion scorched around the Olympic Stadium in 1min 40.91sec to beat the record of 1.41.01 he set in 2010.</p>
	<p>Nijel Amos of Botswana won silver in 1.41.73, while bronze went to Timothy Kitum of Kenya in 1.42.53, both athletes running personal bests.</p>
	<p>Rudisha followed his father Daniel, who won a silver in the 4x400m relay in Mexico in 1968, as a Games medallist but is the first Olympic champion from his Maasai tribe.</p></div>
